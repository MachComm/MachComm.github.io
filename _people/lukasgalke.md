Starting in Sept 2024, I will be an assistant professor for data science
and advanced machine learning at the University of Southern Denmark in Odense.
Between 2022 and 2024, I have been working as a postdoctoral researcher at the
Max Planck Institute for Psycholinguistics, where I explored the very emergence
of communication protocols between neural network agents. I defended my PhD on
representation learning for texts and graphs in 2022 at Kiel University. I
received my MSc degree in Computer Science at the same institution in 2017.
